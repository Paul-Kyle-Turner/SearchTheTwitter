Tweet: @sifisomazibuko @ItsAshHunter I have no idea how you manage to be standby for multiple roles. I'm glad you do though - so keep doin' what you're doin' ;) (And hey, you'll be well placed to do "Hamilton as a one man show" in the future...)

Tweet: Anyone who goes to a show and feels "short-changed" if principle roles are played by an alternate/stand-by should have seen @ItsAshHunter and @sifisomazibuko as Hamilton and Burr respectively this afternoon. First-class performances leading a fabulous cast.
